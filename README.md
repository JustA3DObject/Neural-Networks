The repository contains three folders: one for "Neural networks from Scratch", one for "CIFAR-10 Model" and another for "EEG Spindle Detection and Analysis"
The database used for the EEG Spindle analysis is proprietary and is not allowed to be shared publically so it's not included in the repository.
